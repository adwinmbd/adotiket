# ADOTKT

> A basic support ticketing app.

This project was built to demonstrate how an [Adonis.js](https://adonisjs.com/) api works with [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org).

It is divided into the :

- Front-end built with NuxtJs
- Back-end built with AdoniJs

This project was inspired from this [Scotch.io](https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-a-support-ticket-application-with-adonisjs) tutorial. Check it out to see how the full app is built without using Nuxt.Js in the front-end.
